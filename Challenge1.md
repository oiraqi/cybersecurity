# Security Challenge 1

Your first security challenge consists of selecting two information systems (web applications, web server, DBMS, etc.) used by our University. Preferably (but not necessarily), one should be cloud-based and the other one should be traditional, on-premise.

Then, for each application, give:

1. The type(s) of information it manages
2. The business processes it supports
3. Its high-level security requirements (C.I.A) based on 1 and 2
4. A technical vulnerability (do your best to find one). You need to perform reconnaissance + research. Specify the corresponding CWE
5. The CVSS 3.1 severity score of the discovered vulnerability. Explain the factors that led to that score
6. The security requirement(s) that may be compromised because of the vulnerability
7. The business impact/loss in case the vulnerability is exploited
8. A plausible attack, characterized using CAPEC, that can be used to exercise the vulnerability

4. [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html)
5. [CAPEC](https://capec.mitre.org/data/index.html)

## Very important
1. The discovered vulnerabilities shall be kept confidential, i.e. shared with the course instructor only. Then, the learner and the course instructor shall share the vulnerabilities with the IT department.
2. The learner shall not try to exercise the discovered vulnerabilities.
