# Security Challenge 1

Your first security challenge consists of selecting two web applications used by AUI. Preferably, one should be cloud-based and the other one should be traditional, on-premise.

Then, for each service, give:
1. The type(s) of information it manages (5 pts.)
2. The business processes it supports (5 pts.)
3. Its security requirements based on 1 and 2 (10 pts.)
4. A technical vulnerability (do your best to find one). You need to perform reconnaissance + research (10 pts.)
5. The CVSS 3.1 severity score of each discovered vulnerability. Explain the factors that led to each score (10 pts.)
6. The security requirement(s) that may be compromised because of each vulnerability (5 pts.)
7. The business impact/loss in case each vulnerability is exploited (5 pts.)
8. A plausible attack, as well as the threat agent/vector/source that can be used to exercise each vulnerability (10 pts.)

## Readings
1. CVSS

## Resources
1. National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
2. SecurityFocus.com

## Very important
1. The discovered vulnerabilities shall be kept confidential, i.e. shared with the course instructor only. Then, the student and the course instructor shall share the vulnerabilities with ITS.
2. The student shall not try to exercise the discovered vulnerabilities.
