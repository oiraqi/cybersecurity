# Security Challenge 2 (60 pts.)

Your second challenge will be around [OWASP Benchmark](https://owasp.org/www-project-benchmark/): "a Java test suite designed to evaluate the accuracy, coverage, and speed of automated software vulnerability detection tools". "OWASP Benchmark is a fully runnable open source web application that contains thousands of exploitable test cases, each mapped to specific CWEs".
