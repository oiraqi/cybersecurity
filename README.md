# Cyber Security
## Description
In a continually evolving cyber landscape with current trends of mobility, cloud computing, Web 2.0, as well as integrated apps and services, cyber-attacks are persistently on the rise. This course provides the theoretical knowledge and practical skills to understand and mitigate these attacks. It is structured around four parts:
- **Part I. Cybersecurity foundation:** cyber landscape trends, security requirements, fundamental concepts, principles, and technical controls
- **Part II. Application security:** OWASP Top 10, CWE Top 25, CAPEC, Threat modeling (Focus on STRIDE), and Application-layer IAAA
- **Part III. Network security:** Computer networks review, network security vulnerabilities, On and Off-path attacks, and countermeasures
- **Part IV. Cryptography:** Focus on PKI infrastructure

This course uses a variety of resources. Challenges are designed to allow students to practice the concepts covered in lectures.

## Prerequisites
Senior standing, CSC3371 (Computer Communication)

## Intended Learning Outcomes
This course enables students to achieve, by the end of the semester, the ability to:
1. Describe the C.I.A. security requirements, fundamental concepts, principles and the risk-based approach
2. Explain top application security vulnerabilities, corresponding threats and countermeasures
3. Explain intrinsic network vulnerabilities, corresponding threats and countermeasures
4. Explain the need for cryptography and the fundamentals of PKI
