# Cyber Security
## Description
In a continually evolving cyber landscape with current trends of mobility, cloud computing, Web 2.0, as well as integrated apps and services, cyber attacks are persistently on the rise. This course provides the theoritical knowledge and practical skills to understand and mitigate these attacks. It is structured around four parts:
- **Part I. Cybersecurity foundation:** cyber landscape trends, security requirements, fundamental concepts, principles and technical controls in both traditional and cloud environments
- **Part II. Application security:** Focus on OWASP Top 10 risks, and corresponding countermeasures
- **Part III. Network security:** Computer networks background, network security vulnerabilities, threats and countermeasures
- **Part IV. Cryptography:** Focus on PKI infrastucture

This course uses mainly material developed by Palo Alto Networks, aligned with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework developed by NIST. A variety of other resources are used as needed. Challenges are designed to allow students practice the concepts covered in lectures.

## Prerequisites
Senior standing, CSC3352 (Computer Communication)

## Intended Learning Outcomes
This course enables students to achieve, by the end of the semester, the ability to:
1. Describe the C.I.A. security requirements, fundamental concepts, principles and the risk-based approach
2. Explain top application security vulnerabilities, corresponding threats and countermeasures
3. Explain intrinsic network vulnerabilities, corresponding threats and countermeasures
4. Explain the need for cryptography and the fundamentals of PKI
